- the HTML & CSS chapters weren't anything new for me (structure, styling, etc)
- in the JS chapter, I noticed that some of the vocabulary syntax is outdated
  - using the `var` declaration
  - functions are called methods
  - document.write is used instead of constVariable.textContent
- the planning flowcharts seemed helpful and I'll play around wtih using those on my next project

- overall, good, if dated, stuff and I appreciagte the visual learning element!
